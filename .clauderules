# Claude Code Rules for Image Similarity Comparison Project

## Project Standards

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes

### Git Practices
- Commit after each significant feature or step

- NO co-author tags in commits
- Push only necessary project files (use .gitignore)
- Never commit sensitive data, API keys, or large binary files

### File Organization
- Keep backend and frontend code separated
- Use virtual environment for Python dependencies
- Organize static files (CSS, JS) properly
- Store uploaded images in a dedicated directory (excluded from git)

### Security
- Validate all file uploads (type, size)
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use secure file naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling

### Deep Learning Best Practices
- Use pre-trained models for efficiency
- Document model selection rationale
- Include model performance metrics
- Optimize for inference speed

### Documentation
- Maintain clear README with setup instructions
- Document API endpoints
- Include example usage
- Provide troubleshooting guide
